## ✅ Requirements - Your Catalog Website Should...

- Show off your understanding of basic data structures: **arrays** and **objects**.
- Display a **substantial amount of interesting data** in a "catalog". You can look online for datasets or create your own.  
  Your data should be easy to find in your source code—either in variables at the top of `scripts.js` or imported from a file.
- Include **two or more features** that operate on your data and modify how it's displayed. Examples:
  - Filtering
  - Searching
  - Sorting
  - Updating
  - Adding/removing entries  
    Think about what users might want to do while using your site!
- Look polished ✨. Use **HTML** and **CSS** to make your data easy to read and visually appealing.
- Be built from this **starter code**—you can change anything you want, but build on top of it.
- Be an **original** project. Please do not submit something previously created for a class, internship, or client.  
  You are encouraged to use online resources, but **make sure you understand every line of code** in your project.
